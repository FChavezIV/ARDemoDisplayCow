# ARDemoDisplayCow

## Hardware:
1. Vuzix Blade glasses

## Project:

The goal for this project is to get familiarized with displaying an image to the Vusix Blade AR glasses. To achieve this, we will take a gif of a dancing cow and display it to the user. 

In addition to this, we'd like to learn how to integrate the touch controls embedded in the glasses by a swipe pad. Swiping outward, away from the user, will zoom the virtual cow out. Swiping inwards, towards the user, will zoom in on the cow.

A big goal is to make sure that the cow itself is somewhat transparent along with its surrounding box. 

## Plan: 
Using the emexlabs [WearableIntelligenceSystem](https://github.com/emexlabs/WearableIntelligenceSystem/tree/master) repository, we'll identify good practices and adapt them to our project.

## The image in question:
